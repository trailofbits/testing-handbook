#### Coverage analysis {#coverage-analysis}

Gaining confidence in your code coverage archived during fuzzing is essential for two reasons. Firstly, you want to assess which parts of your applications your fuzzing harnesses execute.

For example, a magic value check, like the one shown in the following figure, may be hard for a fuzzer to overcome. Discovering such a check is important so that the values can be provided to the fuzzer through a [dictionary]({{% relref 02-dictionary %}}) or test cases in the seed corpus.


{{< customFigure "Magic value check that may be difficult to overcome" >}}
```
if (buf == 0x7F454C46) {
    // start parsing buf
}
```
{{< /customFigure >}}


Secondly, when switching your fuzzer or updating your harness or SUT, you want to see whether coverage changes. If coverage decreases, then you may need to extend your harness because new features were introduced. If coverage increases, then you probably improved your harness or the SUT became easier to fuzz.

Fuzzing coverage is a proxy for the capability and performance of the fuzzer. Even though it is widely accepted that coverage [is not ideal for measuring the performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09700) of a fuzzing engine, coverage can tell you whether your harness works in a given setup.

The following flow chart shows an ideal coverage analysis workflow. The workflow uses the corpus generated after each fuzzing campaign to calculate the coverage, which is the preferred method. 



{{< resourceFigure "coverage-flow.svg" "alt" 300>}}
Ideal fuzzing workflow: After each fuzzing campaign the code coverage is evaluated. Based on the results, the SUT or harness is updated and a new fuzzing campaign is started.

{{< hint info >}}
PRO TIP: You should not use the statistics returned by your specific fuzzer to track fuzzing performance over a long time. For example, AFL++ outputs a value that indicates the code coverage. However, this value is non-comparable with other fuzzers because they may calculate this value differently.

The most comparable data is generated by tools specifically made for measuring coverage.
{{< /hint >}}

The following section reviews two methods to generate coverage reports: the an LLVM-based instrumentation and a GCC-based one. LLVM offers a stable and very fast way to generate coverage reports. The LLVM toolkit supports the [SanitizerCoverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html) instrumentation that is unique to Clang and the GCC-comaptible [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) instrumentation. GCC only supports the gcov instrumentation.

Both methods allow the generation of a clear representation of coverage, with the resulting HTML report consisting of multiple pages. However, the report generation with gcov output is more inefficient and requires more time compared to the LLVM one.

##### Code coverage using LLVM's SanitizerCoverage {#code-coverage-using-llvm's-sanitizercoverage}

The LLVM project provides the [SanitizerCoverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html) interface and tooling to allow coverage data collection. The default instrumentation by libFuzzer or AFL++ uses this API during fuzzing to guide the fuzzer toward uncovering more code.

The same LLVM feature can be used to analyze the coverage of a fuzzing corpus. In this section, we describe how to:

1. Build your project for gathering coverage data, independent of the fuzzer you used to generate the corpus
2. Rerun your binary on the fuzzing corpus
3. Convert data to an HTML report

We start by defining a custom runtime called `execute-rt.cc`. This runtime provides a main function that executes an existing corpus.

{{< customFigure "execute-rt.cc: Runtime for executing corpora" >}}
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size);

void load_file_and_test(const char *filename) {
    FILE *file = fopen(filename, "rb");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open file: %s\n", filename);
        return;
    }

    fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END);
    long filesize = ftell(file);
    rewind(file);

    uint8_t *buffer = (uint8_t*) malloc(filesize);
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to allocate memory for file: %s\n", filename);
        fclose(file);
        return;
    }

    long read_size = (long) fread(buffer, 1, filesize, file);
    if (read_size != filesize) {
        printf("Failed to read file: %s\n", filename);
        free(buffer);
        fclose(file);
        return;
    }

    LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(buffer, filesize);

    free(buffer);
    fclose(file);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <directory>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    DIR *dir = opendir(argv[1]);
    if (dir == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open directory: %s\n", argv[1]);
        return 1;
    }

    struct dirent *entry;
    while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
        if (entry->d_type == DT_REG) {
            char filepath[1024];
            snprintf(filepath, sizeof(filepath), "%s/%s", argv[1], entry->d_name);
            load_file_and_test(filepath);
        }
    }

    closedir(dir);
    return 0;
}
```
{{< /customFigure >}}


The following compilation command creates an instrumented binary that can output coverage information.


```shell
clang++ -DNO_MAIN -O2 -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc -o fuzz_exec
```

Similarly to the example in [the libFuzzer section]({{% relref "10-libfuzzer#compile-a-fuzz-test" %}}), we need to disable the default main function. We also need to disable optimizations to make the coverage calculation more precise. The resulting binary outputs coverage data when executed. The first parameter of the resulting binary is a directory with test cases. The following command generates a `fuzz.profraw` file.


```shell
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus/
```


The `.profraw` file must now be converted to an indexed `.profdata` file. Make sure to have the required LLVM tools installed. On Debian/Ubuntu, the package is called `llvm` (e.g., `apt install llvm`). 


```shell
llvm-profdata merge -sparse fuzz.profraw -o fuzz.profdata
```


With access to the coverage binary `fuzz_exec` and a `.profdata` file, we can generate a report. We ignore the harness and execution runtime because we are uninterested in their coverage.


```shell
llvm-cov report ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='harness.cc|execute-rt.cc'
```

The output shows for each file and the total coverage.


```text
Filename       Regions    Missed Regions     Cover   Functions  Missed Functions  Executed       Lines      Missed Lines     Cover    Branches   Missed Branches     Cover
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/root/main.cc       13                13     0.00%           1                 1     0.00%           9                 9     0.00%          12                12     0.00%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL               13                13     0.00%           1                 1     0.00%           9                 9     0.00%          12                12     0.00%
```

A more detailed text-based output can be generated when using `llvm-cov show` instead of `llvm-cov report`. The output can be filtered by appending prefixes of filenames. For example, the following command  prints the output for only the `main.cc` file.


```shell
llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='harness.cc|execute-rt.cc' /root/main.cc
```


The corpus currently covers all lines except for the `abort()` statement, as shown in the next figure.


```C++ {linenos=inline,hl_lines=[8,9]}
       |#include <stdlib.h>
       |#include <string.h>
       |
      3|void check_buf(char *buf, size_t buf_len) {
      3|    if(buf_len > 0 && buf[0] == 'a') {
      3|        if(buf_len > 1 && buf[1] == 'b') {
      1|            if(buf_len > 2 && buf[2] == 'c') {
      0|                abort();
      0|            }
      1|        }
      3|    }
      3|}
```
<!--TODO: highlighted lines are not red!-->

The additional parameter `-format=html -output-dir fuzz_html/` outputs the same information as HTML. It is important to set an output directory, or else the output will be a single HTML file:


```shell
llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='harness.cc|execute-rt.cc' /root/main.cc -format=html -output-dir fuzz_html/
```

{{< resourceFigure "cov1.png" >}}
HTML coverage report generated by `llvm-cov`
{{< /resourceFigure >}}
<!--TODO: Add black border around figure!-->


{{< hint info >}}
PRO TIP: Version 18 of LLVM and Clang (not yet released) can generate index pages for each directory, so that the root page of the report is not filled with hundreds of individual files. Simply append the flags `-format=html`, `-output-dir fuzz_html/`  and `-show-directory-coverage` when invoking `llvm-cov show`.
{{< /hint >}}

Note: Generating coverage data is impossible if your corpus contains inputs that crash. Generating coverage data is possible only if the SUT exits gracefully. Ideally, fix the bugs and then rerun the fuzzer to gather coverage data. That way you can gather coverage data for previously crashing inputs.

Alternatively, filter out crashing inputs manually or automatically. Another way might be to `fork()` the process before executing the SUT (i.e., before calling `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`).

If you want to generate an HTML report using the LLVM stack, then we recommend exporting to the lcov format and then using the lcov tool to generate an HTML page. Using lcov, you can generate a per-source-file report, which is not possible with LLVM before version 18.

```shell
llvm-cov export ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='harness.cc|execute-rt.cc' -format=lcov > fuzz.lcov

apt install lcov
genhtml --output-directory fuzz_html/ fuzz.lcov
```

The resulting HTML is stored in the `fuzz_html/` directory.

##### Code coverage using gcov and gcovr {#code-coverage-using-gcov-and-gcovr}

The [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) instrumentation is provided by both GCC and LLVM. Using gcov, we can use the excellent [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/) tool to generate HTML reports. If using LLVM, the GCC instrumentation can be added using the flags `-ftest-coverage` and `-fprofile-arcs`. Using the `execute-rt.cc` runtime from the previous section, we can compile the coverage binary.


```shell
clang++ -DNO_MAIN -O2 -ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc -o fuzz_exec_gcov
```


The same compilation instruction is also valid for GCC. In this case, replace `clang++` with `g++`.

During compilation, `.gnco` files are created for each object file. During execution, `.gnca` files are created or updated for each object file. The environment variables `GCOV_PREFIX` and `GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP` can be used to copy files across (see [here](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#id2:~:text=By%20default%2C%20the,to%20find%20them.) for more information). For every invocation of the binary, the .gnca files are incrementally updated. This means that executing the program over and over without removing old .gnca files will continuously increment hit counters. The gcovr tool simplifies the handling of these files.

The first step is to execute the coverage binary on an existing corpus.


```shell
./fuzz_exec_gcov corpus/
```

We now make sure that gcovr is installed. We recommend installing gcovr through Python's pip because distribution versions could be outdated. If you use LLVM/Clang 14 or above, at least gcovr 5.1 is required (the verison 5.1 contains this [patch](https://github.com/gcovr/gcovr/pull/525/files#diff-26284e367af8a1344772d5e18ab13d7e5518c701936c21733b2a18c13e2b958cL31-R31)).
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install gcovr
```

A text report for the whole repository can be generated using the just-installed tool. We also exclude non-relevant files:
```
gcovr --gcov-executable "llvm-cov gcov" --exclude harness.cc --exclude execute-rt.cc --root .
```


We must tell gcovr to use the LLVM gcov version and not the GCC one. The same command can also be used if you compiled your coverage binary with GCC; simply omit the `--gcov-executable` flag. We also exclude the harness and our execution runtime from the report.

This will return the following data:

```text
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           GCC Code Coverage Report
Directory: .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File                                       Lines    Exec  Cover   Missing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
main.cc                                        9       8    88%   10
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                          9       8    88%
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The same data can also be outputted in JSON by adding the `--json` flag. An HTML report can be generated by appending `--html-details -o coverage.html`:


```shell
gcovr --gcov-executable "llvm-cov gcov" --exclude harness.cc --exclude execute-rt.cc --root . --html-details -o coverage.html
```


{{< hint info >}}
PRO TIP: The next version of gcovr (version 6.1) will include modern themes for a more pleasant reviewing experience. If you use the master version (`pip3 install git+https://github.com/gcovr/gcovr.git`), you can already enjoy the theme by adding the `--html-theme github.green` flag.
{{< /hint >}}

The output of the HTML report shows the hit counts as well as missed lines:
{{< resourceFigure "cov3.png" >}}

{{< /resourceFigure >}}


**We already mentioned that gcov incrementally updates `.gcda` files over multiple runes of the coverage binaries. To start from scratch, you can manually delete all `.gcda` files after executing gcovr, or add the flag `--delete`.**


##### Real-world examples {#real-world-examples}


###### libpng {#libpng}

We fuzzed libpng with [libFuzzer](#libpng) and [AFL++](#libpng) in previous sections. We now want to determine the strength of our fuzzing by analyzing its coverage.

First we inspect the corpus and verify that we have test cases available by counting them.

```
ls corpus | wc -l
```

Similarly to how we configured libpng for libFuzzer and AFL++, we now configure it differently with the goal of generating a coverage report using LLVM.


```shell
export CC=clang CFLAGS="-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping" # Set C compiler and its flags for generating coverage
export CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS" # Set C++ compiler and use C flags
./configure --enable-shared=no --disable-tools # Configure to compile a static library
make # Run compilation
```


Note that, depending on your fuzzing environment, you may need to install missing dependencies such that the compilation succeeds. For example, on a plain installation of Ubuntu, you may need to install the package `zlib1g-dev` as described above.

We disabled the libpng tools using the `--disable-tools` flag because they cause compilation issues.

To create a binary that outputs coverage data, we first prepare the same harness used during fuzzing.


```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glennrp/libpng/f8e5fa92b0e37ab597616f554bee254157998227/contrib/oss-fuzz/libpng_read_fuzzer.cc
```

Now, we link together the instrumented libpng, the harness, and the execution runtime from the [previous section](#code-coverage-using-llvm's-sanitizercoverage).


```shell
$CXX $CFLAGS libpng_read_fuzzer.cc .libs/libpng16.a execute-rt.cc -lz -o fuzz_exec
```


Finally, we are able to execute the test cases and specify where data should be stored.


```shell
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus/
```


The .profraw file must now be converted to an indexed .profdata file.


```shell
llvm-profdata merge -sparse fuzz.profraw -o fuzz.profdata
```


With access to the coverage binary fuzz_exec and a .profdata file, we can generate a report. We ignore the harness and execution runtime because we are uninterested in their coverage.


```shell
llvm-cov report ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='libpng_read_fuzzer.cc|execute-rt.cc'
```

To generate an HTML report, use:


```shell
llvm-cov show ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='libpng_read_fuzzer.cc|execute-rt.cc' -format=html -output-dir fuzz_html/
```




---

<!-- TODO: Maybe create a new section here -->


For demonstration purposes, we now show how to do the same using GCC. Again we configure libpng to use a specific compiler and compilation flags.


```shell
export CC=gcc CFLAGS="-ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs" # Set C compiler and its flags for generating coverage
export CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS" # Set C++ compiler and use C flags
./configure --enable-shared=no --disable-tools # Configure to compile a static library
make # Run compilation
```


Now, we can link everything together.


```shell
$CXX $CFLAGS libpng_read_fuzzer.cc .libs/libpng16.a execute-rt.cc -lz -o fuzz_exec_gcov
```


Finally, we can execute the existing corpus. The coverage data will be written alongside the object files.


```shell
./fuzz_exec_gcov corpus/
```


Using gcovr, we can generate an HTML report:


```shell
gcovr --exclude libpng_read_fuzzer.cc --exclude execute-rt.cc --root . --gcov-ignore-errors=no_working_dir_found
```

Note that we had to ignore an error using the flag `--gcov-ignore-errors=no_working_dir_found`. This might not be needed for your use case.


###### CMake-based project {#cmake-based-project}

Let's assume we fuzzed the CMake project with [libFuzzer](#cmake-based-project) and [AFL++](#cmake-based-project) and now want to adjust it to generate coverage. The following figure shows a CMakeLists file that defines an executable called buggy_program. Alongside the main binary, a fuzzing binary is defined. Additionally, a binary that can execute existing fuzz test cases is added.


{{< customFigure "CMakeLists file for an example project" >}}
```cmake
project(BuggyProgram)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

add_executable(buggy_program main.cc)

add_executable(fuzz main.cc harness.cc)
target_compile_definitions(fuzz PRIVATE NO_MAIN=1)
target_compile_options(fuzz PRIVATE -g -O2 -fsanitize=fuzzer)
target_link_libraries(fuzz -fsanitize=fuzzer)

add_executable(fuzz_exec main.cc harness.cc execute-rt.cc)
target_compile_definitions(fuzz_exec PRIVATE NO_MAIN)
target_compile_options(fuzz_exec PRIVATE -O2 -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping)
target_link_libraries(fuzz_exec -fprofile-instr-generate)
```
{{< /customFigure >}}


The project can be built using the following commands:


```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ .
cmake --build . --target fuzz_exec
```


We can now run the `fuzz_exec` binary on an existing corpus and generate coverage data. Finally, we can generate a report using the binary. Refer to the libpng real-world example from the previous section for more detailed instructions.


```shell
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE=fuzz.profraw ./fuzz_exec corpus/
llvm-profdata merge -sparse fuzz.profraw -o fuzz.profdata
llvm-cov report ./fuzz_exec -instr-profile=fuzz.profdata -ignore-filename-regex='libpng_read_fuzzer.cc|execute-rt.cc'
```
