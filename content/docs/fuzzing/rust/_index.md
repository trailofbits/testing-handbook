# Rust {#rust}

Just like C/C++, Rust is a systems programming language. The tool stack for fuzzing is therefore related to the one described in the [C/C++ section]({{% relref "c-cpp" %}}), because fuzzers in Rust may be based on those introduced earlier.

For a general introduction about fuzzing and setup (i.e., the harness, fuzzer runtime, instrumentation, and SUT), refer to the [introduction]({{% relref "fuzzing#introduction-to-fuzzers" %}}).
