# Coverage analysis {#coverage-analysis}

Gaining confidence in your code coverage archived during fuzzing is essential for two reasons. Firstly, you want to assess which parts of your applications your fuzzing harnesses execute.

For example, a magic value check, like the one shown in the following figure, may be hard for a fuzzer to overcome. Discovering such a check is important so that the values can be provided to the fuzzer through a [dictionary]({{% relref 02-dictionary %}}) or test cases in the seed corpus.

{{< customFigure "Magic value check that may be difficult to overcome" >}}
```Rust
if (buf == 0x7F454C46) {
    // start parsing buf
}
```
{{< /customFigure >}}

Secondly, when switching your fuzzer or updating your harness or SUT, you want to see whether coverage changes. If coverage decreases, then you may need to extend your harness because new features were introduced. If coverage increases, then you probably improved your harness or the SUT became easier to fuzz.

Fuzzing coverage is a proxy for the capability and performance of the fuzzer. Even though it is widely accepted that coverage [is not ideal for measuring the performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09700) of a fuzzing engine, coverage can tell you whether your harness works in a given setup.

The following flow chart shows an ideal coverage analysis workflow. The workflow uses the corpus generated after each fuzzing campaign to calculate the coverage, which is the preferred method.

Ideal fuzzing workflow: After each fuzzing campaign the code coverage is evaluated. Based on the results, the SUT or harness is updated and a new fuzzing campaign is started.

PRO TIP: You should not use the statistics returned by your specific fuzzer to track fuzzing performance over a long time. For example, AFL++ outputs a value that indicates the code coverage. However, this value is non-comparable with other fuzzers because they may calculate this value differently.

The most comparable data is generated by tools specifically made for measuring coverage.
{{< /hint >}}

The cargo-fuzz tool can output coverage for your corpus. Based on the acquired coverage data, we can use standard Rust tools to generate an HTML report.

The cargo-fuzz tool requires the llvm-tools-preview component to be installed for the used nightly toolchain:


```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly --component llvm-tools-preview
```


Now, use cargo-fuzz to output coverage data. The cargo-fuzz tool will recompile your project with coverage instrumentation and then run through all test cases in the corpus.


```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz coverage fuzz_target_1
```


The cargo-fuzz tool will report that merged coverage has been written to a `.profdata` file. Next, we need the tools [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils) and [rustfilt](https://github.com/luser/rustfilt) installed.


```shell
cargo install cargo-binutils
cargo install rustfilt
```

Create the following script and make it executable. We create a script because the manual invocation of the coverage generation is quite complex.

```sh
cat <<'EOF' > ./generate_html
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Error: Name of fuzz target is required."
    echo "Usage: $0 fuzz_target [sources...]"
    exit 1
fi
FUZZ_TARGET="$1"
shift
SRC_FILTER="$@"
TARGET=$(rustc -vV | sed -n 's|host: ||p')
cargo +nightly cov -- show -Xdemangler=rustfilt \
  "target/$TARGET/coverage/$TARGET/release/$FUZZ_TARGET" \
  -instr-profile="fuzz/coverage/$FUZZ_TARGET/coverage.profdata"  \
  -show-line-counts-or-regions -show-instantiations  \
  -format=html -o fuzz_html/ $SRC_FILTER
EOF
chmod +x ./generate_html
```
{{< /customFigure >}}

Finally, we can generate an HTML report and save it to `fuzz_html/`.


```shell
./generate_html fuzz_target_1 src/lib.rs
```

PRO TIP: The following table lists the invoked cargo command in more detail:
|||
|--- |--- |
|`cargo +nightly cov --`|Invokes the llvm-cov tool from the Rust toolchain|
|`show`|This subcommand can generate HTML reports|
|`-Xdemangler=rustfilt`|Use the [rustfilt](https://github.com/luser/rustfilt) demangler for better function names|
|`"target/$TARGET/coverage/$TARGET/release/$FUZZ_TARGET"`|Path to the instrumented Rust binary or object file|
|`-instr-profile="fuzz/coverage/$FUZZ_TARGET/coverage.profdata"`|Path to the merged coverage data|

|`-format=html -o fuzz_html/`|Sets the format to HTML and outputs the HTML files to a directory|
|`src/lib.rs`|Optionally, you can add paths to source files to filter the output. In this case, we are interested only in the lib.rs file.|

## Real-world examples {#real-world-examples}


### Cargo crate: ogg {#cargo-crate-ogg}

In a [previous section](#cargo-crate-ogg) we fuzzed the ogg crate. Now we want to evaluate the coverage of our fuzzing campaign to verify we achieved good coverage.

First, we inspect the corpus and verify that we found test cases.


```shell
ls fuzz/corpus/fuzz_target_1/ | wc -l
```

Then we generate merged coverage data from the corpus:
```shell
cargo +nightly fuzz coverage fuzz_target_1
```

Finally, we generate an HTML report and use domain knowledge to assess the fuzzing performance by using the `generate_html` script introduced in the [Coverage analysis](#coverage-analysis) section.

We may need to find more diverse seeds or fix bugs in our harness if the code coverage is unexpectedly low. However, no single number determines bad coverage; this depends significantly on how the crate is written and how difficult it is to reach certain code.
