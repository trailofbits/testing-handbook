# Fuzzing dictionary {#dictionary-fuzzing}

A dictionary can be used to guide the fuzzer. A dictionary is usually passed as a file to the fuzzer. The simplest input accepted by libFuzzer is a ASCII text file where each line consists of a quoted string. Strings can contain escaped byte sequences like "`\xF7\xF8"`. Optionally, a key-value pair like `hex_value="\xF7\xF8"` can be used for documentation purposes. Comments are supported by starting a line with `#`. See the following example:



{{< customFigure "Example dictionary file. More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/ef706ad668b36e65d24f352f5bcee22957f5f1cc/dictionaries)" >}}
```conf
# Lines starting with '#' and empty lines are ignored.

# Adds "blah" (w/o quotes) to the dictionary.
kw1="blah"
# Use \\ for backslash and \" for quotes.
kw2="\"ac\\dc\""
# Use \xAB for hex values
kw3="\xF7\xF8"
# the name of the keyword followed by '=' may be omitted:
"foo\x0Abar"
```

Dictionaries are compatible between the libFuzzer, cargo-fuzz, and AFL++ fuzzers. They can be used according to the following table:


|||
|--- |--- |
|`libFuzzer`|`./fuzz -dict=./dictionary.dict ...`|
|`AFL++`|`afl-fuzz -x ./dictionary.dict ...`|
|`cargo-fuzz`|`cargo fuzz run fuzz_target -- -dict=./dictionary.dict`|

## Generating a dictionary {#generating-a-dictionary}

There are several ways to generate a dictionary.



* LLMs (large language models): Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT are helpful in generating a dictionary for your fuzzing task. However, be aware of LLM hallucinations. If the LLM proposes a feature not mentioned in this handbook, check first if it really exists. Try the following LLM prompt with the task `PNG parser`:
    ```text {.code-fence-wrap}
    A dictionary can be used to guide the fuzzer. A dictionary is passed as a file to the fuzzer usually.
    The simplest input accepted by libFuzzer is an ASCII text file where each line consists of a quoted string. Strings can contain escaped byte sequences like "\xF7\xF8". Optionally, a key-value pair can be used like hex_value="\xF7\xF8" for documentation purposes. Comments are supported by starting a line with #. Write me an example dictionary file for a <fuzzing task>:
    ```
* Header files: If you found C header file that contains relevant strings, then they can be extracted using the following command:
    ```shell
    grep -o '".*"' header.h > header.dict
    ```
* Man pages: If the project you are fuzzing has man pages, then you can use these to generate a dictionary. This is especially helpful when fuzzing a CLI.
    ```shell
    man curl | grep -oP '^\s*(--|-)\K\S+' | sed 's/[,.]$//' | sed 's/^/"&/; s/$/&"/' | sort -u > man.dict
    ```
* AFL++ [AUTODICTIONARIES](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/108fb0b29ad1586e668ba23e23a0eb1a13c45c49/instrumentation/README.lto.md#autodictionary-feature): If you are using `afl-clang-lto`, then AFL++ will automatically generate a dictionary based on the binary that is being fuzzed.
* If you are not using AFL++, then you might want to use the strings binary to generate dictionary:
    ```shell
    strings ./binary | sed 's/^/"&/; s/$/&"/' > strings.dict
    ```
