# Zero-knowledge protocols

ZKDocs provides comprehensive, detailed, and interactive documentation on zero-knowledge proof systems and related primitives.

At [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), we audit many implementations of non-standardized cryptographic protocols and often find the same issues. As we discovered more instances of these bugs, we wanted to find a way to prevent them in the future. Unfortunately, for these protocols, the burden is on the developers to figure out all of the low-level implementation details and security pitfalls.

We hope that ZKDocs can fill in this gap and benefit the larger cryptography community.
