# Continuous Integration

## CI/CD integration

In this chapter, we will walk you through the process of integrating Semgrep into your GitHub repository
as part of your continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline.

### Recommended Semgrep GitHub integration approach

We recommend integrating Semgrep with GitHub Actions using the following approach:

1. Schedule a full Semgrep scan on the main branch with a broad set of Semgrep rules (e.g., `p/default`).
2. Implement a diff-aware scanning approach for pull requests, using a fine-tuned set of rules that yield high
   confidence and true positive results.
3. Once your Semgrep implementation is mature, configure Semgrep to block the PR pipeline if there are
   unresolved Semgrep findings.
   - See: [Require status checks before merging / GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)

### Understanding Semgrep CI configuration options

Familiarize yourself with the available environment variables and their default values by reviewing the [Configuration reference](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/configuration-reference/).
The following are key points to note:

- Semgrep checks for new versions by default, as controlled by the `SEMGREP_ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK` variable.
- By default, Semgrep sets a five-minute timeout for each individual Git command that Semgrep runs (`SEMGREP_GIT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`).
- Semgrep attempts to scan each file with a 30-second timeout (`SEMGREP_TIMEOUT`) and retries up to three times (`--timeout-threshold`).
- The `SEMGREP_RULES` environment variable defines the rules used by Semgrep. You can specify multiple rule sources
  by separating them with a space.
- By default, the CI process fails if findings are detected but passes if internal errors occur. For more information, see
[Passing or failing the CI job](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/running-semgrep-ci-without-semgrep-app/#passing-or-failing-the-ci-job).
- See the example job that uploads findings to [GitHub Advanced Security Dashboard](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/sample-ci-configs#:~:text=Alternate%20job%20that%20uploads%20findings%20to%20GitHub%20Advanced%20Security%20Dashboard).

#### Adding custom Semgrep rules to CI/CD

When you want to use your own custom rules in addition to the standard rulesets (such as `p/default` or `p/javascript`)
passed to the `SEMGREP_RULES`, follow the steps below:

1. If your custom Semgrep rules directory **is in the same** repository as the scanned code,
       just pass the directory path in the `SEMGREP_RULES` variable:
      (e.g., `SEMGREP RULES: p/default custom-semgrep-rules-dir/`)

2. If your custom Semgrep rules **are in another private repository**, do the following:

    a. [Generate an access token for the repository with Semgrep rules](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
    Remember to select the least scopes necessary.

    b. [Add the generated access token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
    to the repository where the workflow is run

    c. Add the `actions/checkout` step in a job after the main source code checkout with:
      - The `repository` name
      - Personal access `token` (PAT) used to fetch the repository
      - Relative `path` to place the repository

    d. Pass the path to the directory with custom Semgrep rules in the `SEMGREP_RULES` environment variable

    {{< hint info >}}
If your repository with custom rules is publicly available, just omit the steps where you create the PAT and do not pass
the `token` in the checkout step.
    {{< /hint >}}

    For example:

    ```yaml
    # Set up an environment variable with the name of the private repository with custom Semgrep rules
    env:
      SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO: semgrep-private-rules
    steps:
        # Main checkout of the repository source code
      - name: Checkout main repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # Checkout of the repository with custom Semgrep rules
      - name: Checkout private custom Semgrep rules
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }} # organization-name/Semgrep-rules-repo
          token: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_RULES_TOKEN }} # Configured PAT
          path: ${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }} # Relative path to place the repository
        # ...
      - run: semgrep ci
      env:
        # Pass the directory with the checked-out Semgrep rules repository
        SEMGREP_RULES: ${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }}
    ```

### GitHub integration steps

Follow these steps to integrate Semgrep with your GitHub repository:

1. Create a `semgrep.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of the repository you want to scan.
2. Copy the code snippet below into the `semgrep.yml` file. This workflow is based on two jobs:
     - The first job:
       - Runs on a schedule basis (once per month).
       - Runs when a pull request is merged.
       - Runs when there is a direct push on the main/master branch.
       - Uses the broad `p/default` Semgrep rule.
     - The second job:
       - Runs specifically for pull requests.
       - Uses multiple security-related rules.

```yaml {linenos=inline}
# Define the name of this GitHub Actions workflow.
name: Semgrep
on:
  # Run the workflow on pull_request events for diff-aware scanning.
  pull_request: {}
  # Run the workflow on push events to mainline branches to report all findings.
  push:
    branches: ["master", "main"]
  # Schedule the workflow to run periodically using cron syntax.
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *' # Schedule Semgrep to run once per month (at 00:00 on day-of-month 1).
# Define the jobs that run as part of this workflow.
jobs:
  # Define the first job for scheduled scanning and mainline branch scanning.
  semgrep-schedule:
    # Define the conditions for running this job. Run on schedule, push to master/main, or merged PR.
    # Skip any PR created by Dependabot to avoid permission issues.
    if: ((github.event_name == 'schedule' || github.event_name == 'push' || github.event.pull_request.merged == true)
        && github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')
    # Name this GitHub Actions job.
    name: Semgrep default scan
     # Define the environment in which the job runs.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      # Use a Docker image with Semgrep pre-installed.
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    # Set up an env variable - the name of the (private) repository with custom Semgrep rules
    # env:
      # SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO: semgrep-private-rules
    steps:
      # Use the GitHub Actions Checkout step to fetch the project source code.
      - name: Checkout main repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # In case you have a (private) repository with custom Semgrep rules:
      # - name: Checkout custom Semgrep rules
      #   uses: actions/checkout@v4
      #   with:
      #     repository: ${{ github.repository_owner }}/${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }}
      #     token: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_RULES_TOKEN }} # If the repository is private
      #     path: ${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }}
       # Execute the "semgrep ci" command within the Semgrep Docker container.
      - run: semgrep ci
        env:
          # Set the SEMGREP_RULES environment variable to specify which rules Semgrep should use.
          # Use common security-related rulesets for this job (starting with `p/`)
          # or use a directory with your custom rules from the current repository (such as `semgrep-rules/`).
          SEMGREP_RULES: >
            p/default
            semgrep-rules/
        # Pass the directory with the checked-out Semgrep rules repository
        #    ${{ env.SEMGREP_PRIVATE_RULES_REPO }}
  # Define the second job for scanning pull requests.
  semgrep-pr:
    # Define the conditions for running this job. Run only within Pull Requests, excluding Dependabot PRs.
    if: (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]')
    # Name this GitHub Actions job.
    name: Semgrep PR scan 
    # Define the environment in which the job runs.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      # Use the GitHub Actions Checkout step to fetch the project source code.
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    steps:
      # Fetch project source with GitHub Actions Checkout.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Execute the "semgrep ci" command within the Semgrep Docker container.
      - run: semgrep ci
        env:
          # Set the SEMGREP_RULES environment variable to specify which rules Semgrep should use.
          # Use common security-related rulesets for this job (starting with `p/`)
          # or use a directory with your custom rules from the current repository (such as `semgrep-rules/`).
          SEMGREP_RULES: > 
            p/cwe-top-25
            p/owasp-top-ten
            p/r2c-security-audit
            p/javascript
            p/trailofbits
            semgrep-rules/
```

This configuration ensures that your codebase is scanned regularly for potential issues
and that new code introduced through pull requests is thoroughly checked for security vulnerabilities.
